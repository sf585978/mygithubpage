          <p>The simplest story to tell about SUNY Geneseo's Writing Learning Center (WLC) over the last year is the story of growth. The WLC, to get right to the point, had more client interactions over the course of the 2014-2015 school year than any other in its history, having recorded 1,913 client interactions from September 2014 to May 2015. These nearly 2,000 client interactions mark a triumphant success for the Writing Learning Center in moving to an online client-driven model for making appointments with writing tutors. Now, more than ever, clients are empowered to seek out and obtain the help they feel they need when it comes to writing.</p>

          <p>Of course, a 116% increase in client interactions over two years means little without some context for the growth. If our clients are simply rushing to come in when key assignments or finals are due, the growth rate would be substantially less impressive. Such a client pattern would, in fact, indicate a distinct lack of core value in the WLC, as it would suggest that students mainly used it as a final method for proofreading, not a service for consistent learning and skill improvement. However, the incredible growth of the WLC has not been so superfluous. The data collected over the 2014-2015 school year indicate that students are consistently accessing the WLC over the course of the semester.</p>

          <p>The plot above is absolutely crucial to understanding why the WLC's growth has been so healthy. The graph depicts the running total of client interactions through every week of each semester.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The most important feature to consider is the near linear quality of each semester. The appearance of a steady increase in client interactions suggestst that Geneseo students are adopting the WLC into their educational routines so as to attempt to maximize their academic potential and learn to write better.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It comes as a relief, then, for many to see that the WLC has made strong positive steps to establish an infastructure and collection of tutors that can accommodate the needs of Geneseo's student body.</p>

          <p>Of course, the steady progression of growth over the course of the semester is only a single aspect of the substantial growth the WLC has experienced. The WLC's growth is as much about the ability to support the needs of the general student population as it is about providing targeted support for specific areas. Going in to the 2014-2015 academic year, the WLC went out of its way to tailor some of its tutor training to the needs of Geneseo's leveling classes: INTD 105, HUMN 220, and HUMN 221. The reasons for these choices were entirely practical; previous study had shown that these three classes comprised at least half of the WLC's client interactions. When it comes to growth, the effects of  these leveling classes are similar; the leveling classes have seen the largest amount of impactful growth of any subject areas.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> As such, the WLC feels as if its training was effective and appropriate for its client base. The data speak to, if nothing else, the tutors' abilities to work with clients in these extremely important content areas.</p>

          <p>However, the recognition that INTD 105 and HUMN make up such a large portion of WLC client interactions is not just a comment on the quality of preparation to help these areas by the WLC tutors. Rather, the fact that Geneseo's leveling classes make up a large percentage of the WLC's client interactions also indicates a wide spread lack of  confidence on the part of students to complete the writing assignments given to them in these classes. To put it more bluntly, the leveling classes, especially INTD 105, are not accomplishing their stated goals for developing student writers. Students maintain a level of anxiety about writing through their mandatory humanities experiences. Over 11% of the students taking a Fall 2014 HUMN class came to the WLC for help,  with 64% of that group indicating that they were not first-time WLC clients. What these results seem to indicate is that there is a subset of the student population - a subset that is likely to be greater than 11% as there certainly is a group of students who struggle with writing and do not seek out help for any number of reasons -  that leaves INTD 105 - or maybe never takes INTD 105 if they are a transfer student - uncomfortable with the analytic writing process. For these students, HUMN is a challenge because as much as the college emphasizes the two courses as leveling courses in regards to content, the HUMN program at Geneseo is as much a series of writing courses as it is a series of content-oriented courses. Almost all assessments given in HUMN classes require some form of analytic writing, with a significant portion being take home or in-class essays. The fact of the matter is that from Fall 2009 to Spring  2013, HUMN had one of the lowest mean expected grades, as reported by students in their SOFI Reports.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

          <p>As it turns out, HUMN classes expect to do worse than the school-wide expected average of 3.40. Of course, it should be stated that the fact that HUMN students expect to get B's is not a problem, nor is it concerning out of context. However, the concern arises when students leave their INTD classes expecting to do well, but then not in HUMN. If students were leaving INTD 105 classes having learned all that the INTD 105 program hopes they will, students would expectedly perform better in later writing intensive classes, like HUMN. Instead, the shift from INTD 105 to HUMN sees a sharp decline in expected student performance.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> The issue that the data indicate is one of a lack of real preparation. Students are clearly making it from INTD 105 to HUMN without developing their writing skills to the same standard they expect their other academic skills to reach. Somewhere along the way, writing has lost its importance either for students, teachers, or both.</p>

          <p>We are left one important question then: what can the college do to turn these results around? As it stands, we will try to only focus on realistic solutions that could be implemented without creating a major disruption to the school's academic systems. The obvious and most likely to succeed solution involves integrating the WLC more closesly into the INTD 105 and HUMN experiences. Since every student has to take these classes and they are likely the most writing intensive classes most students will take, finding ways to incorporate the WLC into these programs will expose the WLC to more students than if it is only advertised through word of mouth. The WLC provides the strongest base of support for students and can provide an immediate confidence and skill boost. Program integration could take the form of the WLC supplying in class writing assistance when needed or dedicated preparation to support specific activities or assessments. No matter how the WLC is integrated, the focus should be on developing ways that the WLC can reach more students and provide more beneficial support in the process.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="u-full-width">
          <p>Another, increasingly realistic, solution is the adoption of online tutoring. The concept of online tutoring is one that the WLC has tried to develop over the past year. So far, no truly effective method has been developed and accepted by the WLC. However, recently, the discovery of software like <a href="">Annotation Studio</a> and <a href="">Paper Grader</a> now make it entirely possible to outsource the most complicated software development problems and easilly implement simple tutoring solutions. Going forward, it will be easy and not cost the WLC anything to offer online tutoring sessions. One way these online sessions may manifest themselves is in the form of 15 minute micro-sessions. Noramlly, clients can reserve 30 minute sessions or hour-long sessions if they are ESL students. The inclusion of a 15 minute option will allow tutors to address low level issues like grammar and quick "direction" checks where clients can have tutors check to make sure they are on the right track with their writing. Pushing these types of proof-reading and low impact readings to the web will allow the WLC to accomplish two goals:
          <ol>
            <li>The WLC will be able to help more students of all levels by simplifying the process and making it more accessible;</li>
            <li>The WLC will be able to promote more productive writing habits across campus by making it easier for students to receive feedback on small elements early and often, an important concept for mainting lean efficiency while writing.
