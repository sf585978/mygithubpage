              <h3>About</h3>

              <p>I am a current PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/students/sean-fischer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Annenberg School for Communication">Annenberg School for Communication</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I work with <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/yphtach-lelkes-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Yphtach Lelkes">Yphtach Lelkes</a> and am a member of the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/working-groups/democracy-information-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Democracy and Information Group">Democracy and Information Group</a> and the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/working-groups/digital-media-networks-and-political-communication-research-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Digital Media, Networks, and Political Communicatio Group"> Digital Media, Networks, and Political Communication Group</a>. My current research occurs at the intersection of computational science, political science, and cultural studies. I am particularly interested in the feedback loop between cultural products and political identity. My proposed dissertation will assess the relationship between partisanship and cultural taste, employing both experiments and observational network analyses.</p>

              <p>In 2016, I earned degrees in English Literature and Mathematics from SUNY Geneseo, a small state college in Upstate New York. My senior honors thesis provided a sociological perspective on the social functions of critics and criticism in the 21st Century. In 2014, I helped start <a href="www.canonicity.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Canonicity Project">The Canonicity Project</a>, a student led research group, with my good friend Ben Wach and our research advisor Dr. Gillian Paku. My research ended up involving the study of literary spaces and their manipulation, and how they influence our perception of culture. In particular, I worked on developing a theoretical framework for critiquing cultural objects that matches the standards for rigor and ethics necessary of the field.</p>

              <p>While I did not have much of it, I spent my time outside of academics contributing to Geneseo's cross country and track and field teams. In my undergraduate years, my personal bests were: <a href="https://www.tfrrs.org/results/xc/8125.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="">25:14 for the 8k</a>, <a href="https://www.tfrrs.org/results/42168_2660115.html?athlete_hnd=4636204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="">15:34 for the 5k</a>, and <a href="http://www.tfrrs.org/results/36235_2559402.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="">31:20 for the 10k</a>. In 2013, <a href="http://www.tfrrs.org/results/xc/6216.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="">I ran at my first NCAA D3 Cross Country Championships.</a> In 2014 and 2015, I had the honor of captaining the Geneseo Cross Country team. In 2015, <a href="https://www.tfrrs.org/results/xc/9349.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="2015 NCAA Cross Country Results">I ran in my second NCAA D3 Cross Country Championships, helping Geneseo earn a 3rd place finish, the highest finish in the program's history.</a> Today, while I do not run as much, I now devote some of my free time during the fall cross country season to collecting race results and using speed ratings to predict the team results at the D3 championships.</p>

  						<p>There is little doubt over the existence of affective polarization, but findings on the related causal effects of party cues on non-political behavior may be affected by design decisions related to the volume and types of information used in experiments, as well as the trust framework employed. Here, we consider how these effects vary across low and high information environments for a less impactful trust context replicating initial trust conditions. We find that in low trust conditions, the effects of party cues are stable between party groups and are strong relative to the effects of other pieces of information about race, gender, religion, religiosity, policy preferences, and cultural preferences. However, such effects are reduced and become highly moderated by party affiliation within the high information environment. These findings suggest that differences between the implications of earlier research on the behavioral consequences of affective polarization and daily life may be explained by assumptions made inthe design of earlier studies.</p>

  						<p>This study audits the role of search engines in disseminating local news in US communities. In recent years, there have been mounting concerns about the consolidation of the newspaper industry into the hands of a few large corporations, which have all but wiped out smaller newspapers that are stakeholders in local communities. A recent study conducted by the University of North Carolina reported that about 3.2 million people in about 200 counties in the United States live in a "news vaccuum": a place without any weekly or daily newspaper. Furthermore, about 1300 US communities are in danger of becoming news deserts -- places where residents are facing significantly diminished access to the sort of important news and information that feeds grassroots democracy. However, little is understood of the role of technology -- specifically, search engines -- which act as a gatekeeper to news access, by ranking and prioritizing certain news sources over the others. In this study, we collected location-specific news results for U.S. counties, for a diverse set of local- and national-news keywords. Our findings suggest that search engines can divert readership and online traffic away from local journalism and thus exacerbate America's growing news deserts. Even controlling for the number of news sources, we observe systematic biases in which communities get local news, and which do not.</p>
