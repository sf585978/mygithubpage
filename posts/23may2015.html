              <p>I am pretty sure that I am about 5 years late in coming to appreciate <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i>. The acclaimed thriller novel has produced a handful of critically acclaimed films and has become a piece of essential summer reading for thousands of thriller junkies across the world. I had meant to read the novel years ago, but just now set aside the time necessary to read/listen to Stieg Larsson's work. What I found as I entered the world of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander was at times horrific, but almost always well paced and mysterious so as to capture my complete attention.</p>

              <p>My first thought on finishing TGWTDT was that I wished I could read in Swedish. I found the English version gripping, but in some ways highly contrived. I felt that some  of the choices in expression were rather cliche and probably stand ins for the more elegant Swedish expressions that Larsson had used in his original version. However, the chunky and sometimes cliched language allowed the text to highlight the action, which did not require any subtlety. I found myself not worrying too much about the complexities of Blomkvist or Salander and their peers, instead appreciating the way that the narrative, at least in English, pushed the action. I never felt trapped in anyone's head. The moments of internal monologue were nicely situated inside of larger sequences, thankfully diminishing their importance given their rough nature in the English translation.</p>
              <p>Beyond any intracacies of translation, the most interesting aspect of TGWTDT had to be the short hop into the past. Written and originally published in the first years of the 21st Century, TGWTDT contains marker after marker of our recent past. The emphasis on technology and the specfic descriptions of computers and other aparati help to establish a conflict in the setting. As a reader coming to TGWTDT about a decade after it was originally written, the world that the characters inhabit is both on the cutting edge of advancement and horrifically left behind. The technological tricks that end up saving the day feel horribly archaic, if only because they are so easy to consider now. In the post-Edward Snowden world, information security is not an entirely mysterious concept. Yet, TGWTDT's reliance on the specific description of technology gives the text an entirely futuristic atmosphere. As someone who was a young child during the time that TGWTDT is set, I found the contrast to be quite enjoyable. I found myself considering just what these now small advances in technology must have felt like for people like my parents; the anxiety of moving away from the analog world of someone like Henrik Vanger to the digital world of Lisbeth, a world that we currently expand more and more every day, is entirely present and in many ways entirely driving throughout TGWTDT.</p>
              <p>The anachronistic conflict is only furthered, as it turns out, by the text's focus on extreme violence towards women. Unfortunately, no part of the crimes described within TGWTDT feel entirely trapped in the past. Reading TGWTDT 15 years into the 21st Century is a reminder that the violence that still plauges Western societies, especially the violence towards women, is not a unique manifestation of this moment in time. The horrific violence that TGWTDT brings forward has been a feature of our world for some time. TGWTDT reminds its readers that violence is a commonality that is usually just poorly hidden by society. The images of sadism are perhaps extreme, but are somehow still acceptable, playing off of the extremes that we as readers have become all too used to seeing on the covers of newspapers. The sadism, though, is a connection to the past and helps to further develop the text's conflict between the old and the new. Just as with the presentation of technology, the presentation of violence for a contemporary reader forces the reader to reconcile the state of the created past in TGWTDT and the state of their own present where such horrific acts seem just as likely to take place. The conflict is likely and should be uncomfortable for all well adjusted readers. The suggestions that TGWTDT make are disturbing. As readers it is important to consider them, but also then <i>the reasons why</i> they are so disturbing.</p>
              <p>Going forward, I hope that the final two installments in Larsson's trilogy live up to the expectations set by TGWTDT. In particular, I am extremely curious to see if the anachronistic conflict that has become a feature of TGWTDT as time has progressed in the real world remains such a central aspect of the later texts. Further, I am curious to see if the depictions of violence become any more severe. The violence throughout TGWTDT was already dramatic and very intense, but I could see it being raised to another level through even more detail oriented descriptions of specific acts. I'm not sure how I will react to any sort of escalation in the violence; it is already so horrific that it was at times hard to stomach. To be honest, I'm not sure I can even see a definite purpose to increasing it such.</p>
